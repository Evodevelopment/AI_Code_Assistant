# OpenAI API Usage

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create quick and effective applications. These applications are designed to be easy to implement, use, and build upon. The project is inspired by hands-on experimentation with Python, insights from various tech meetups, and relevant coursework. It reflects a deep enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and an earnest desire to explore its vast potential and applications.

## Motivation

This project is driven by two main goals:

- **Passion for AI:** Engaging deeply with the AI landscape to discover its capabilities and transition theoretical knowledge into practical implementations.
- **Expanding Horizons:** Enhancing understanding of the OpenAI API's diverse applications and demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing real-world challenges.

## Features
- **Interactive AI Demonstrations:** Showcases real-time interactions with AI models, providing immediate insights and responses.
- **Scalable Integration Examples:** Demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI API into existing systems or workflows for enhanced functionality.
- **Customization Capabilities:** Allows users to tailor AI responses for specific applications, making it a versatile tool for developers.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenAI_API_Usage.git
cd OpenAI_API_Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python your_script.py --example "Type your query here"
```
Replace `"Type your query here"` with your specific input to interact with the AI.

## AI-Powered Code Assistant

### Introduction
This part of the project is an AI-powered code assistant using the OpenAI API. It provides code completions, suggestions, explanations, and debugging assistance to enhance the coding experience.

### Features
- **Code Completion and Suggestions:** Provide real-time code completions based on the current context.
- **Explanations and Documentation:** Offer explanations for various coding concepts and provide links to relevant documentation or tutorials.
- **Debugging Assistance:** Identify common coding errors and suggest fixes, and offer explanations for error messages.
- **Integration with Code Editors:** Integrate with popular code editors like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a seamless experience.

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Code_Assistant.git
   cd AI_Code_Assistant/ai_code_assistant
   ```
2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add your OpenAI API key to `config.py`.

5. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### VS Code Extension Setup
1. Navigate to the `vscode-extension` directory:
   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   ```
2. Install dependencies and run the extension:
   ```bash
   npm install
   code .
   ```

3. Press `F5` to start debugging the extension.
